This folder contains a collection of Python programs developed as part of the FoCP module. The work is organised by week and demonstrates progressive development.

Week 2 – User Input & Basic Calculations

Introduces interactive programs using keyboard input. Tasks include greeting users, temperature conversion, group allocation calculations, and fair distribution problems using arithmetic and division logic. 

Week 3 – Control Flow & Validation

Focuses on conditional logic and loops. Programs include password validation systems with multiple constraints and times table generators with forward and reverse output options. 

Week 4 – Functions & Data Processing

Introduces reusable functions for validation, string analysis, temperature conversion, and statistical calculations (minimum, maximum, and mean). Emphasis is placed on clean function design and robustness. 

Week 5 – Command-Line Arguments & Files

Explores writing programs that run from the command line. Tasks include argument counting, platform detection, URL checking, file backup creation, and processing numerical inputs via command-line parameters. 

Week 6 – Algorithms & Simple Encryption

Covers number systems, prime checking, factorisation, and basic encryption techniques such as string reversal and interval-based character hiding, along with corresponding decryption programs. 

Week 7 – Data Structures & Analysis

Introduces sets and dictionaries for solving problems involving unique letters, comparisons between words, managing country–capital pairs, and performing frequency analysis on text data. 

Week 8 – File Processing & Unix-Style Tools

Focuses on practical utilities inspired by Unix commands, including implementations of nl, diff, grep, wc, and a basic spell checker. Emphasis is placed on real-world usefulness and text file manipulation.
